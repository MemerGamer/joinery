 * process. A one-shot HTTP/CLI call (e.g. `joinery files <id>`) goes through
 * the same `requireEngine` path as a live review window and would otherwise
 * leak both for the life of the server.
 *
 * `SWEEP_INTERVAL_MS` is how often the registry looks for idle workers.
 * `IDLE_GRACE_MS` is how long an unwatched worker survives after its last
 * `get()` before it's disposed. A live review window always watches its
 * `review:<id>` topic (`subscriberCount > 0`), so it is exempt from the sweep
 * no matter how long it sits idle on screen — only unwatched workers age out.
 * Stored state doesn't depend on any of this: the repo pollers keep it
 * current whether a worker runs or not.
